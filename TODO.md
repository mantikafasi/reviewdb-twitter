# things to do
- [x] make css files work
- [x] sanitize code
- [x] fix esbuild config for watch
- [x] write build script and get rid of webpack all together
- [x] somehow declare react globally
- [x] add someway to reauthorize (maybe with popup)
- [x] create a very simple authorization page
- [x] create a simple popup for extension which displays user info
- [x] Make it look good on white & non black theme // kinda done?
- [x] Maybe use twitter popouts instead so we look more native
- [x] close popup automaticly after clicking on reviews button
- [ ] fix reviews modal causing error on refresh (possibly because of patching another router)
- [x] when not logged in prevent twitters footer from overlapping reviews
- [x] use "history" instead of messing with react internals
- [x] fix meatball not working on modal
~~ALL DONE AGAIN :blobcatcozy:~~
