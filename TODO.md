- [x] sanitize code
- [x] fix esbuild config for watch
- [x] write build script and get rid of webpack all together
- [x] somehow declare react globally
- [x] add someway to reauthorize (maybe with popup)
- [x] create a very simple authorization page
- [x] create a simple popup for extension which displays user info
